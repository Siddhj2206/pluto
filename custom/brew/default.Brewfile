# pluto — default brew preinstalls (auto-installed at first login).

# Every Brewfile in this directory is copied to
# /usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/preinstall.d/ and applied automatically by
# brew-preinstall.service (content-addressed by hash — edit to re-apply).
#
# Policy: only USER tools live here. System tools (build-time, systemd
# services, first boot before brew, desktop integration) stay in the base
# image (build/packages/base.toml) — e.g. ghostty is native on purpose.
